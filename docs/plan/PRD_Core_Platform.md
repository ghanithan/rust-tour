# PRD: Rust Learning Platform - Core Platform

## Overview
A GitHub-based learning platform that teaches Rust programming through progressive exercises following "The Rust Programming Language" book structure.

## Problem Statement
Learning Rust can be challenging due to its unique concepts (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes). Existing learning resources are either:
- Pure theory (books, documentation) without hands-on practice
- Complex projects that overwhelm beginners
- Lack structured progression and feedback

## Target Users

### Primary: Rust Beginners
- Developers with 0-2 years programming experience
- Experienced developers new to Rust
- Computer science students
- Self-taught programmers

### Secondary: Rust Educators
- Bootcamp instructors
- University professors
- Corporate training teams
- Open source maintainers

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Exercise completion rate: >70% for first 5 chapters
- Session duration: 30-45 minutes average
- Return rate: >60% within 1 week
- Chapter progression: >50% complete at least 10 chapters

### Learning Effectiveness
- Time to complete basic ownership concepts: <2 weeks
- Code quality improvement (measured via Clippy warnings)
- Successful progression through difficulty levels

### Platform Growth
- GitHub stars: 1000+ in first 3 months
- Forks: 200+ in first 3 months
- Community contributions: 10+ contributors in 6 months
- Codespaces usage: 500+ unique users in first quarter

## Core Features

### 1. Progressive Learning Path
**Description**: 20 chapters following Rust Book structure with prerequisite enforcement
**User Story**: As a learner, I want to progress through Rust concepts in logical order without skipping prerequisites
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Cannot access chapter N+1 without completing 70% of chapter N exercises
- Clear visual indication of locked/unlocked content
- Prerequisite concepts clearly listed for each chapter

### 2. Exercise Types
**Description**: Five distinct exercise formats catering to different learning styles
**User Story**: As a learner, I want varied exercise types to reinforce concepts differently
**Types**:
- **Code Completion**: Fill-in-the-blank exercises with clear TODO markers
- **Bug Fixing**: Broken code with compilation/logic errors to fix
- **From Scratch**: Complete implementations from specifications
- **Code Review**: Analyze and improve existing code for best practices
- **Performance Challenges**: Optimize code for speed/memory with benchmarks

### 3. Automated Testing & Validation
**Description**: Comprehensive test suite for immediate feedback
**User Story**: As a learner, I want instant feedback on my solutions
**Features**:
- Unit tests for correctness
- Integration tests for larger programs
- Clippy integration for code quality
- Benchmark tests for performance exercises
- Custom assertion messages for common mistakes

### 4. Hint System
**Description**: Three-tier progressive hint system
**User Story**: As a learner, I want guidance when stuck without giving away the solution
**Levels**:
1. **Conceptual Hint**: Points to relevant documentation/concept
2. **Strategic Hint**: Suggests approach without code
3. **Implementation Hint**: Specific code guidance

### 5. Solution Explanations
**Description**: Detailed explanations with multiple approaches
**User Story**: As a learner, I want to understand not just the solution but alternative approaches
**Components**:
- Step-by-step solution breakdown
- Alternative implementations
- Common mistake patterns
- Performance implications
- Best practice explanations

## Technical Requirements

### Platform
- **Primary**: GitHub Repository + Codespaces
- **Backup**: Local development with Docker
- **Language**: Rust (exercises), Python (scripts), JavaScript (web UI)

### Performance
- Exercise startup time: <5 seconds in Codespaces
- Test execution: <2 seconds for unit tests
- Web UI responsiveness: <200ms for interactions

### Compatibility
- GitHub Codespaces (primary)
- VS Code Dev Containers
- Local Docker development
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## User Journey

### Onboarding (First 15 minutes)
1. Fork repository or open in Codespaces
2. Run initialization script
3. Complete "Hello World" exercise
4. View progress dashboard
5. Access first real exercise

### Learning Session (30-45 minutes)
1. Select next available exercise
2. Read exercise description and requirements
3. Implement solution in provided template
4. Run tests for immediate feedback
5. Use hints if stuck (max 1 per level per session)
6. View solution explanation after completion
7. Update progress automatically

### Progress Review (Weekly)
1. View completed exercises dashboard
2. Review skill tree visualization
3. Identify weak areas needing review
4. Access personalized exercise recommendations

## Dependencies

### External
- GitHub (repository hosting, Codespaces)
- Rust toolchain (cargo, rustc, clippy)
- Docker (for dev containers)

### Internal
- Exercise framework (custom)
- Progress tracking system (JSON-based)
- Web UI (optional but recommended)
- CLI tool (optional companion)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Codespaces limitations**: Mitigate with local Docker fallback
- **Rust compilation time**: Pre-compiled templates, incremental compilation
- **Exercise complexity**: Thorough testing, user feedback integration

### User Experience Risks
- **Overwhelming beginners**: Progressive disclosure, clear prerequisites
- **Lack of motivation**: Achievement system, progress visualization
- **Getting stuck**: Comprehensive hint system, community support

### Business Risks
- **GitHub dependency**: Platform-agnostic design for potential migration
- **Maintenance burden**: Community contribution system, automated testing
- **Competition**: Focus on unique progressive approach and GitHub integration

## Non-Goals (V1)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Video tutorials or multimedia content
- Advanced IDE features beyond basic editing
- Mobile app development
- Paid premium features
- Live instructor interaction
- Certificate generation

## Future Considerations (V2+)
- VS Code extension for enhanced IDE integration
- Advanced analytics and learning insights
- Community marketplace for custom exercises
- Integration with educational institutions
- Multi-language support beyond Rust
- AI-powered personalized learning paths
