cd exercises/ch01_getting_started/ex01_hello_world && cargo test

# Check exercise solution
./scripts/check-exercise.sh ch01 ex01

# Run all exercise validations
./scripts/run.sh test

# Lint code (Clippy integration)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Test Docker build
docker build -t rust-tour-test .

# Test CLI help system
cargo run --package rust-tour -- --help

# Test with custom options
cargo run --package rust-tour -- --port 8080 --debug-websocket
```

### Publishing to crates.io
```bash
# Build with embedded assets and download features
cargo build --release --package rust-tour --features "embed-assets,download-exercises"

# Test the published binary workflow
./target/release/rust-tour

# Publish (dry run)
cargo publish --package rust-tour --dry-run

# Actual publish
cargo publish --package rust-tour
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build production Docker image
docker build -t rust-tour .

# Run with port forwarding and progress persistence
docker run -d \
  --name rust-tour \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/progress:/app/progress \

```

## Architecture

### Core Structure
The project follows a chapter-based exercise structure:
- `exercises/chXX_topic/` - Individual chapter exercises
- `solutions/` - Reference solutions for all exercises
- `scripts/` - Automation scripts for testing and progress tracking
- `web-server/` - Rust web server with integrated terminal support
- `progress.json` - Git-trackable progress file

### Exercise Framework
Each exercise follows this pattern:
- `src/main.rs` or `src/lib.rs` - Student implementation area
- `tests/` - Automated test cases
- `hints.md` - Progressive hint system (3 levels)
- Individual `Cargo.toml` for exercise-specific dependencies

### Exercise Types
1. **Code Completion** - Fill missing parts in skeleton code
2. **Bug Fixing** - Fix compilation/logic errors
3. **From Scratch** - Complete implementation from specs
4. **Code Review** - Analyze and improve existing code
5. **Performance Challenges** - Optimization exercises with benchmarks

## Development Workflow

### Creating New Exercises
1. Create chapter directory: `exercises/chXX_topic_name/`
2. Add exercise subdirectory: `exYY_exercise_name/`
3. Include: `src/`, `tests/`, `hints.md`, `Cargo.toml`
4. Update chapter README with exercise list
5. Add automated tests in `tests/` directory
6. Create progressive hints (beginner â†’ intermediate â†’ advanced)

### Exercise Validation
- All exercises must pass `cargo test`
- Include both unit tests and integration tests
- Use `cargo clippy` for code quality
- Performance exercises should include benchmarks
- Test cases should cover edge cases and common mistakes

### Progress System
- JSON-based tracking in `progress.json`
- Automatic updates via exercise completion scripts
- Tracks: completion status, time spent, difficulty rating, hints used
- Supports skill tree visualization and adaptive difficulty

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions/modules
- Integration tests for complete exercise solutions
- Benchmark tests for performance challenges
- Automated CI via `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Clippy linting integrated into validation pipeline

## File Naming Conventions
- Chapters: `chXX_topic_name/` (snake_case)
- Exercises: `exYY_exercise_name/` (snake_case)
- Scripts: `kebab-case.sh` or `snake_case.py`
- Rust files: standard Rust conventions

## Key Implementation Notes
- Each exercise is a separate Cargo project for isolation
- Progressive difficulty within chapters (beginner â†’ intermediate â†’ advanced)
- Hint system provides 3 levels of assistance
- Solutions include multiple approaches where applicable
- Community contribution system for additional exercises
- Adaptive difficulty based on user performance metrics

## Hint System Guidelines

### Three-Level Progressive Hints (hints.md)
```markdown
# Hints for [Exercise Title]

## Level 1: Conceptual Hint
- Explain the theoretical concepts
- Link to relevant Rust Book sections
- Provide high-level understanding
- No code examples, focus on concepts

## Level 2: Strategic Hint  
- Explain the approach and methodology
- Show syntax patterns without complete solutions
- Guide toward the right direction
- Include partial code examples

## Level 3: Implementation Hint
- Provide near-complete or complete solutions
- Explain every part of the implementation
- Show multiple approaches if applicable
- Include full working code examples
```

### Hint Quality Standards
- **Progressive disclosure**: Each level reveals more detail
- **Educational focus**: Teach concepts, not just solutions
- **Multiple learning styles**: Visual, textual, and code examples
- **Common mistakes**: Address typical student errors
- **Rust Book integration**: Link to relevant chapters and sections

## Exercise Types & Approaches

### 1. Code Completion Exercises
**Purpose**: Fill missing parts in skeleton code
```rust
fn main() {
    // TODO: Print "Hello, world!" to the console
    // Your code here
}
```
**Guidelines**:
- Use `// TODO:` or `unimplemented!()` markers
- Provide sufficient context around blanks
- Include comments explaining expected behavior
- Tests should guide toward correct implementation

### 2. Bug Fixing Exercises
**Purpose**: Fix compilation and logic errors
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5
    println!("The value is {}", y);  // Multiple intentional bugs
}
```
**Guidelines**:
- Include 2-4 strategic bugs (compilation + logic)
- Bugs should teach common Rust mistakes
- Error messages should guide toward solutions
- Tests should fail initially, pass when fixed

### 3. From Scratch Exercises
**Purpose**: Complete implementation from specifications
**Guidelines**:
- Provide clear requirements and specifications
- Include comprehensive test suite
- Start simple, build complexity gradually
- Multiple valid approaches should be acceptable

### 4. Code Review Exercises
**Purpose**: Improve working but non-idiomatic code
**Guidelines**:
- Provide functional but suboptimal code
- Focus on Rust best practices and idioms
- Include performance or safety improvements
- Explain trade-offs in different approaches

### 5. Performance Challenge Exercises
**Purpose**: Optimization and benchmarking
**Guidelines**:
- Include baseline implementation
- Provide benchmarking framework
- Set reasonable performance targets
- Explain optimization techniques used

## Testing Standards

### Test Philosophy: Functional & Outcome-Based
**DO**: Test actual program behavior and outcomes
```rust
#[test]
fn test_hello_world_output() {
    let output = Command::new("cargo")
        .args(&["run", "--quiet"])
        .output()
        .expect("Failed to execute program");
    
    let stdout = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout);
    assert!(stdout.trim() == "Hello, world!", "Expected 'Hello, world!' output");
}
```

**DON'T**: Test for specific code patterns (heuristic testing)
```rust
// BAD - Don't do this
#[test]
fn test_contains_println() {
    let source = std::fs::read_to_string("src/main.rs").unwrap();
    assert!(source.contains("println!"), "Code should use println! macro");
}
```

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (tests/unit_tests.rs)
- Test individual functions and modules
- Verify correctness of implementation
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Use realistic inputs and expected outputs

#### Integration Tests
- Test complete program workflow
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Test interaction between components
- Include performance benchmarks for optimization exercises

#### Quality Assurance
- Automated via `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt`
- Custom validation in platform (not test files)
- Memory safety and best practices
- Documentation completeness

## Educational Approach

### Concept Progression
1. **Incremental Learning**: Each exercise builds on previous concepts
2. **Contextual Application**: Exercises demonstrate real-world usage
3. **Multiple Perspectives**: Show different ways to solve problems
4. **Error Learning**: Common mistakes become learning opportunities

### Difficulty Scaling
- **Beginner**: Single concept, clear instructions, guided implementation
- **Intermediate**: Multiple concepts, some ambiguity, require problem-solving
- **Advanced**: Complex scenarios, optimization, architectural decisions

### Rust Book Integration
- **Primary Chapter**: Core concept being taught
- **Supporting Chapters**: Background knowledge needed
- **Specific Sections**: Exact references with URLs
- **Relevance Tags**: How each section relates to the exercise
