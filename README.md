## Built with Claude Code

This entire project was created using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) in GitHub Codespaces - a delightful paradox worth noting! We've used AI to build a platform that champions traditional, hands-on learning. While AI helped architect the codebase, generate exercises, and design the learning framework, **the fundamental truth remains**: programming mastery requires human understanding, critical thinking, and practice.

### The Beautiful Contradiction

It's wonderfully ironic - an AI helped create a platform that emphasizes the irreplaceable value of human programming knowledge. This collaboration highlights a crucial principle: **AI amplifies human expertise but cannot replace it**. Every line of code generated was reviewed, refined, and validated by human judgment. Every exercise was crafted to build real understanding, not just pattern matching.

### Why Programming Knowledge Still Matters

Even in an AI-enhanced world, deep programming knowledge remains essential:

- **Verification**: You need to understand code to validate AI output
- **Architecture**: System design requires human creativity and judgment  
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems is a uniquely human skill
- **Quality Assurance**: Recognizing good vs. problematic code requires experience
- **Innovation**: Building novel solutions demands understanding fundamentals

### The Claude Code Experience

This project demonstrates the productive partnership between human developers and AI:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Ideas became working code in minutes
- **Documentation Excellence**: Comprehensive guides generated efficiently  
- **Best Practices**: AI knowledge of patterns combined with human oversight
- **Creative Problem Solving**: Human creativity directed by AI implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Human validation ensuring production-ready results

**Built entirely in GitHub Codespaces with Claude Code** - proving that the future of development is collaborative intelligence, where AI and human expertise create something greater than either could achieve alone.

*"The best tools amplify human capability rather than replace it. Rust Tour stands as testament to this principle."*

### Release Process

We use an automated release process with AI-generated release notes:

**Creating a Release:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Run **"Create Release"** workflow
3. Enter version number (e.g., `0.1.0`)
4. Select release type (`patch`, `minor`, `major`)
5. The workflow will:
   - Run full validation suite
   - Generate AI-powered release notes
   - Create git tag and GitHub release
   - Trigger Docker image builds automatically

**Manual Release Steps (Alternative):**
```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0

# This automatically triggers the release workflow
# Docker images will be built and published to GHCR
```

**Release Artifacts:**
- **GitHub Release** with generated changelog
- **Docker Images** on GHCR:
  - `ghcr.io/ghanithan/rust-tour:latest`
  - `ghcr.io/ghanithan/rust-tour:v0.1.0`
