# Exercise 10: If/Else Control Flow

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will understand:
- How to use `if` expressions for conditional logic
- Building `else if` chains for multiple conditions
- Using `if` in `let` statements for conditional assignment
- Combining boolean expressions with logical operators
- Nested conditional statements for complex logic
- Best practices for readable conditional code

## Exercise Description
This exercise focuses on Rust's conditional control flow using `if` expressions. You'll fix compilation errors and complete missing logic to build comprehensive conditional statements.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **If Expressions**: Basic conditional logic
- **Else If Chains**: Multiple condition checking
- **Boolean Conditions**: Using comparison and logical operators
- **Conditional Assignment**: Using `if` in `let` statements
- **Nested Conditionals**: Complex decision trees
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!` in conditions

## Instructions
1. Fix compilation errors in conditional statements
2. Complete missing boolean conditions
3. Implement else if chains for grade assignment
4. Use `if` expressions for conditional assignment
5. Build complex boolean logic for decision making
6. Focus on creating readable, logical conditional flow

## Expected Output
Your program should demonstrate:
- Temperature comfort checking
- Voting eligibility verification
- Grade assignment based on scores
- Activity selection based on weather
- Driving eligibility with multiple conditions
- Restaurant recommendations with time-based logic
