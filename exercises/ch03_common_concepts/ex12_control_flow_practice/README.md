# Exercise 12: Control Flow Practice

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will understand:
- How to combine all control flow concepts in a practical application
- Building complex conditional logic for game mechanics
- Using loops and conditionals together effectively
- Function design for modular game logic
- Error handling and edge case management
- Real-world application of Rust fundamentals

## Exercise Description
This comprehensive exercise combines all Chapter 3 concepts in a practical number guessing game. You'll implement game logic, scoring systems, and helper functions while demonstrating mastery of control flow.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Control Flow Integration**: Combining if/else with loops
- **Function Design**: Breaking logic into reusable functions
- **Boolean Logic**: Complex conditional expressions
- **Loop Control**: Managing game flow with loops
- **Error Handling**: Input validation and edge cases
- **Practical Application**: Real-world programming patterns

## Instructions
1. Complete the main game loop with conditional logic
2. Implement helper functions for game mechanics
3. Add proper comparison logic for guess checking
4. Build scoring and validation systems
5. Ensure the game handles all edge cases correctly
6. Focus on clean, readable code structure

## Expected Output
Your program should demonstrate:
- A functioning number guessing game
- Proper feedback for guesses (too high/low/correct)
- Attempt counting and limit enforcement
- Game completion with appropriate messages
- Integration of all control flow concepts

## Key Implementation Details
- Secret number is 42 (for testing consistency)
- Maximum 5 attempts allowed
- Predefined guesses: [25, 60, 40, 42] for testing
- Proper win/lose condition handling
- Helper functions for categorization and validation
