# Exercise 8: Comments in Rust

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will understand:
- Different types of comments in Rust (line, block, documentation)
- When and how to use each comment type effectively
- Best practices for writing helpful comments
- How to comment out code for debugging or testing
- Documentation comment syntax for functions and structs

## Exercise Description
This exercise teaches you how to write effective comments in Rust. Comments are crucial for code maintainability and help other developers (including your future self) understand your code.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Line Comments**: Using `//` for single-line explanations
- **Block Comments**: Using `/* */` for multi-line comments
- **Documentation Comments**: Using `///` for function/struct documentation
- **Comment Best Practices**: When and what to comment
- **Code Documentation**: Writing helpful explanations

## Instructions
1. Read through the existing comments to understand different styles
2. Replace all TODO comments with appropriate comment content
3. Add line comments explaining what variables represent
4. Comment out specified lines and blocks as requested
5. Add documentation comments for functions and structs
6. Focus on writing helpful, explanatory comments (not just stating what the code does)

## Expected Behavior
Your program should:
- Compile and run without errors
- Display temperature conversion results
- Show function call results
- Demonstrate comment styles
- NOT display any content from commented-out sections

## Validation
Run `cargo test` to verify your implementation works correctly and comments are properly placed.
