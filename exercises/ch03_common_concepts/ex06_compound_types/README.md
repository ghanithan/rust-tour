# Exercise 6: Compound Data Types

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will understand:
- How to create and use tuples in Rust
- How to create and manipulate arrays
- Tuple and array destructuring patterns
- Indexing and accessing compound type elements
- When to use tuples vs arrays
- Basic slicing operations

## Exercise Description
This exercise introduces Rust's compound types - data structures that can hold multiple values. You'll work with tuples (which can hold different types) and arrays (which hold multiple values of the same type).

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Tuples**: Fixed-size collections of different types
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections of the same type
- **Destructuring**: Extracting values from compound types
- **Indexing**: Accessing individual elements
- **Pattern matching**: Using patterns to extract values

## Instructions
1. Read through the code and understand what each part demonstrates
2. Replace the TODO comments with working code
3. Focus on the differences between tuples and arrays
4. Pay attention to destructuring syntax
5. Run the program to see your results

## Expected Output
Your program should demonstrate:
- Tuple creation and element access
- Array initialization and manipulation
- Destructuring of both tuples and arrays
- Iteration over compound types
- Functions that work with compound types
