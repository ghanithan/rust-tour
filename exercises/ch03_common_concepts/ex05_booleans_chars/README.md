# Exercise 5: Boolean and Character Types

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will understand:
- How to use Rust's `bool` type for logical operations
- How to work with Rust's `char` type for Unicode characters
- Logical operators: AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), NOT (`!`)
- Comparison operators and boolean expressions
- Character methods and Unicode support in Rust
- Combining booleans and characters in practical applications

## Exercise Description
This exercise focuses on Rust's scalar types `bool` and `char`. You'll learn to work with logical operations, character methods, and Unicode support while building practical examples.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Boolean Type**: `true` and `false` values
- **Logical Operators**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Character Type**: Unicode scalar values
- **Character Methods**: `.is_alphabetic()`, `.is_numeric()`, `.to_lowercase()`
- **Unicode Support**: Working with international characters and emojis

## Instructions
1. Read through the code to understand the structure
2. Replace all TODO comments with working code
3. Focus on logical operations and character methods
4. Test with different character types (letters, digits, Unicode)
5. Run the program to see your boolean logic and character operations in action

## Expected Output
Your program should demonstrate:
- Boolean logic operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- Comparison operations
- Character classification (alphabetic, numeric, etc.)
- Unicode character handling
- Practical combinations of booleans and characters
