# Exercise 11: Loop Constructs

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will understand:
- Different types of loops in Rust: `loop`, `while`, and `for`
- When to use each loop type appropriately
- Loop control with `break` and `continue`
- Returning values from loops
- Iterating over ranges and collections
- Loop labels for nested loop control

## Exercise Description
This exercise covers all of Rust's loop constructs. You'll complete implementations for infinite loops, conditional loops, and iteration patterns while learning proper loop control techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Loop Keyword**: Infinite loops with `break`
- **While Loops**: Conditional repetition
- **For Loops**: Iteration over ranges and collections
- **Loop Control**: `break` and `continue` statements
- **Loop Values**: Returning values from loops
- **Nested Loops**: Multiple loop levels
- **Iterator Patterns**: Modern Rust iteration

## Instructions
1. Complete missing loop conditions and bodies
2. Implement proper loop control with break/continue
3. Use appropriate loop types for different scenarios
4. Practice iteration over ranges and collections
5. Implement nested loops for complex patterns
6. Focus on choosing the right loop type for each task

## Expected Output
Your program should demonstrate:
- Counting loops with break conditions
- Loops that return values
- Countdown with while loops
- Range-based for loops
- Array iteration patterns
- Nested multiplication tables
- Conditional loop control
