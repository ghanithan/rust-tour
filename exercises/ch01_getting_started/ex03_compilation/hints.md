# Hints for Understanding Compilation and Error Messages

## Level 1: Conceptual Hint

Rust's compiler is designed to catch errors before your program runs, making your code safer and more reliable. When you see compilation errors:

1. **Don't panic!** - Errors are helpful feedback, not criticism
2. **Read carefully** - The compiler tells you exactly what's wrong and where
3. **Fix one at a time** - Start with the first error and work your way down
4. **Look for patterns** - Many errors have similar causes

Key concepts to understand:
- **Syntax errors**: Problems with how you wrote the code (missing semicolons, quotes, etc.)
- **Name errors**: Using variables or functions that don't exist or are misspelled
- **Type errors**: Trying to use data in ways that don't match its type

The Rust compiler is one of the most helpful in any programming language - it often suggests exactly how to fix the problem!

## Level 2: Strategic Hint

To fix compilation errors systematically:

1. **Run `cargo build`** to see all errors
2. **Focus on the first error** - later errors often disappear when you fix earlier ones
3. **Look at the line number** and column indicated in the error
4. **Read the error message** - it usually tells you exactly what's wrong

For this exercise, you have these types of errors:
- **Missing punctuation** (semicolons, quotes)
- **Typos in variable names** 
- **Typos in function/macro names**

Each error message will point you to:
- The exact line where the problem is
- What the compiler expected to see
- Sometimes a suggestion for how to fix it

Remember: Rust requires semicolons after statements, and variable names must be spelled exactly right!

## Level 3: Implementation Hint

Here are the specific fixes needed:

**Error 1 - Missing semicolon (line 6):**
```rust
// Wrong:
println!("Hello from Rust!")

// Right:
println!("Hello from Rust!");
```

**Error 2 - Typo in variable name (line 10):**
```rust
// Wrong: 
println!("The answer is: {}", answr);

// Right:
println!("The answer is: {}", answer);
```

**Error 3 - Missing closing quote (line 13):**
```rust
// Wrong:
println!("Rust compilation is awesome!);

// Right:
println!("Rust compilation is awesome!");
```

**Error 4 - Wrong macro name (line 17):**
```rust
// Wrong:
printline!("Compilation errors are learning opportunities!");

// Right:
println!("Compilation errors are learning opportunities!");
```

The corrected `main.rs` should look like:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Rust!");
    
    let answer = 42;
    println!("The answer is: {}", answer);
    
    println!("Rust compilation is awesome!");
    
    println!("Compilation errors are learning opportunities!");
}
```
